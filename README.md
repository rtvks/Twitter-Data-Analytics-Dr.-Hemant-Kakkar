Twitter-Data-Analytics-Dr.-Hemant-Kakkar

Assignment: The aim of my mini assignment was to scrap out data from twitter. The data consisted of tweets corresponding to the user’s name and the no. of tweets required for the analysis. Read Dr. Kakkar’s research papers  to manipulate the scrapped out twitter data. Manually coded that data into different categories and then analysed th personality with the help of graphs and other tools

Here are the general steps involved in conducting social media analysis:

1.	Data Collection:
•	Identify the social media platform and specific dataset you want to analyze (e.g., Twitter).
•	Access the Twitter API or use third-party tools to collect tweets based on your research objectives.
•	Store the collected data in a suitable format (e.g., JSON or CSV).

2.	Data Cleaning:
•	Preprocess the collected data to remove any irrelevant or duplicate information.
•	Normalize the text data by removing punctuation, stop words, and special characters.
•	Handle any missing or null values in the dataset.

3.	Sentiment Analysis:
•	Apply sentiment analysis techniques to determine the sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral) of each tweet.
•	Utilize pre-trained sentiment analysis models or develop your own using machine learning techniques.
•	Assign sentiment scores or labels to each tweet.

4.	Data Analysis and Visualization:
•	Conduct exploratory data analysis to identify patterns, trends, and insights within the dataset.
•	Calculate relevant statistical measures such as frequency counts, averages, or correlations.
•	Visualize the data using graphs, charts, or interactive dashboards to present your findings effectively.

Python: Python is a widely used programming language for data analysis and offers various libraries and frameworks for social media analysis. Some key libraries include:

•	Tweepy: A Python library for accessing the Twitter API.
•	NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit): A library for natural language processing and sentiment analysis.
•	Pandas: A library for data manipulation and analysis.
•	Matplotlib and Seaborn: Libraries for data visualization.
